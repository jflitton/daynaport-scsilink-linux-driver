# daynaport-scsilink-linux-driver

A loadable Ethernet driver for the **DaynaPORT SCSI/Link** SCSI-to-Ethernet
adapter, as emulated by [BlueSCSI V2](https://bluescsi.com/),
[ZuluSCSI](https://zuluscsi.com/), and [PiSCSI](https://github.com/PiSCSI/piscsi).
It binds to the SCSI processor device the adapter presents and exposes it as a
standard Ethernet interface (`eth0`) — letting a vintage (or modern) machine use
a BlueSCSI/ZuluSCSI/PiSCSI DaynaPORT emulation as a SCSI-attached NIC. Each
driver builds out-of-tree as a loadable module against its kernel's source.

The Linux SCSI and networking subsystems were rewritten many times across the
2.0 → 7.x span, so a single source file can't span them. Instead the repo holds
**one self-contained driver per kernel era**, each in its own directory, sharing
only what is genuinely version-independent (the DaynaPORT protocol logic).

## Supported kernels

| Kernel target | Directory                | Status                              | Driver version |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Linux 2.0.x   | [`linux-2.0/`](linux-2.0/) | Working — tested on 486SLC @ 33MHz / AHA-1542 / BlueSCSI V2 | 0.3 |
| Linux 7.x     | [`linux-7.0/`](linux-7.0/) | Working — tested on x86-64 / 53c875 (FirePort 40) / BlueSCSI V2 | 0.1 |

```

The protocol logic — opcode/framing constants **and** the RX record parser —
lives once in [`lib/daynaport.h`](lib/daynaport.h). It is kernel-API-free and
C89-clean, so the same header compiles under gcc 2.7.x for the 2.0 driver and a
modern toolchain for later ports; each driver supplies its own per-frame delivery
callback that hands packets up the era's network stack.

## Build & install

Each driver builds out-of-tree from inside its own directory, and both install
the same way (`./install.sh`, as root). For Linux 2.0 specifics see
[`linux-2.0/README.md`](linux-2.0/README.md):

```sh
cd linux-7.0          # or linux-2.0
./install.sh          # build, install, depmod (as root)
```

The Linux 7.x driver builds as `scsilink.ko` via kbuild against the running
kernel's build tree (`/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build`); load it with `modprobe
scsilink`. The RX poll cadence is tunable at load — e.g. `modprobe scsilink
poll_ms=80 poll0_ms=20 fast_hold=16`.

Pre-built release tarballs are on the
[releases](https://github.com/jflitton/daynaport-scsilink-linux-driver/releases)
page; each is self-contained (the shared header and `COPYING` are flattened in
alongside the driver source).
